Parallel::Fork::BossWorker
==========================

Parallel::Fork::BossWorker makes creating multiprocess applications easy.

The module is designed to work in a queue style of setup; with the worker
processes requesting 'work' from the boss process. The boss process
transparently serializes and sends the work data to your work handler, to be
consumed and worked. The worker process then transparently serializes and
sends optional data back to the boss process to be handled in your result
handler.

This process repeats until the work queue is empty.

See the POD documentation in BossWorker.pm for details on how to use
P:F:BW.
