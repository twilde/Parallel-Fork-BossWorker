=head1 NAME

Parallel::Fork::BossWorker - Perl extension for easily creating forking queue processing applications.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The minimal usage of Parallel::Fork::BossWorker requires you supply
the work_handler argument which returns a hash reference.

    use Parallel::Fork::BossWorker;
    
    # Create new BossWorker instance
    my $bw = Parallel::Fork::BossWorker->new(
        work_handler => sub {
            my $work = shift;
            ... do work here ...
            return {};
        }
    );
    
    $bw->add_work({key=>"value"});
    $bw->process();

Additionally, you could specify the result_handler argument, which
is passed the hash reference returned from your work_handler.

    use Parallel::Fork::BossWorker;
    
    # Create new BossWorker instance
    my $bw = Parallel::Fork::BossWorker->new(
        work_handler => sub {
            my $work = shift;
            ... do work here ...
            return {result => "Looks good"};
        },
        result_handler => sub {
            my $result = shift;
            print "$result->{result}\n";
        }
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parallel::Fork::BossWorker makes creating multiprocess applications easy.

The module is designed to work in a queue style of setup; with the worker
processes requesting 'work' from the boss process. The boss process
transparently serializes and sends the work data to your work handler, to be
consumed and worked. The worker process then transparently serializes and sends
optional data back to the boss process to be handled in your result handler.

This process repeats until the work queue is empty.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(...)

Creates and returns a new Parallel::Fork::BossWorker object.

    my $bw = Parallel::Fork::BossWorker->new(work_handler => \&routine)

Parallel::Fork::BossWorker has options which allow you to customize
how exactly the queue is handled and what is done with the data.

=over 4

=item * C<< work_handler => \&routine >>

The work_handler argument is required, the sub is called with it's first
and only argument being one of the values in the work queue. Each worker calls
this sub each time it receives work from the boss process. The handler may trap
$SIG{ALRM}, which may be called if global_timeout is specified.

The work_handler should clean up after itself, as the workers may call the
work_handler more than once.

=item * C<< result_handler => \&routine >>

The result_handler argument is optional, the sub is called with it's first
and only argument being the return value of work_handler. The boss process
calls this sub each time a worker returns data. This subroutine is not affected
by the value of global_timeout.

=item * C<< global_timeout => $seconds >>

By default, a handler can execute forever. If global_timeout is specified, an
alarm is setup to terminate the work_handler so processing can continue.

=item * C<< worker_count => $count >>

By default, 10 workers are started to process the data queue. Specifying
worker_count can scale the worker count to any number of workers you wish.

Take care though, as too many workers can adversely impact performance, though
the optimal number of workers will depend on what your handlers do.

=item * C<< msg_delimiter => $delimiter >>

Sending messages to and from the child processes is accomplished using
Data::Dumper. When transmitting data, a delimiter must be used to identify the
breaks in messages. By default, this delimiter is "\0\0\0", this delimiter may
not appear in your data.

=head2 add_work(\%work)

Adds work to the instance's queue.

    $bw->add_work({data => "my data"});

=head2 process()

Forks off the child processes and begins processing data.

    $bw->process();

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

This module depends on the following modules:

Carp

Data::Dumper

IO::Handle

IO::Select

=head1 BUGS

If we knew about any bugs, we would have fixed them. :)
